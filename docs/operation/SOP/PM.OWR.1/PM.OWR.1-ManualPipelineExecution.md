## Introduction

This Pipeline Manager manages the execution of the Oncoanalyser WGTS RNA pipeline. Here we describe the SOP for manual execution of the pipeline.

## Requirements

- appropriate AWS permissions
- AWS credentials set up in the local environment
- tools installed
  - AWS CLI
  - JQ

## Procedure

To initate a pipeline execution we need to generate an initial DRAFT event. For more details consult the main [README](../../../../README.md).
For convenience we provide a shell script that generates and optionally submits an appropriate event.

- familiarise yourself with the script: [generate-WRU-draft.sh](./generate-WRU-draft.sh)
  - especially check the settings in the `Globals` section
    - ensure the values are fit for your use case, e.g. for clinical samples match the accredited pipeline details
  - and you understand how to set the input parameters through the CLI, use the `--help` flag if needed.
- execute the script (e.g. `bash generate-WRU-draft.sh`)
  - Note: AWS credentials need to set on the environment
- the script should produce the JSON output of the DRAFT event. This should be used to ensure it reflects the intended request
  - take note of the generated `workflowRunName` or `portalRunId`
- the script will now submit the DRAFT event and it should complete successfully

## Confirmation

The OrcaBus [Portal](https://portal.umccr.org/) can be used to check whether the event resulted in a WorkflowRun record.

- navigate to the Portal's WorkflowRun listing: https://portal.umccr.org/runs/workflow
- search for your WorkflowRun using the `workflowRunName` or `portalRunId`
- confirm that the WorkflowRun is listed and progressing as expected (check over time)
- once the WorkflowRun as `SUCCEEDED` the results should be available via the Portal's [Files](https://portal.umccr.org/files) view
  - simply filter by the `portalRunId`
